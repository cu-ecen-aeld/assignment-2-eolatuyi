# assignment 2
# Description:
#    Write a shell script finder-app/writer.sh as described below
#    
#    Accepts the following arguments: the first argument is a full path to a file (including filename) on the filesystem, 
#    referred to below as writefile; the second argument is a text string which will be written within this file, referred to below as writestr
#    
#    Exits with value 1 error and print statements if any of the arguments above were not specified
#    
#    Creates a new file with name and path writefile with content writestr, overwriting any existing file and creating the path if it doesnâ€™t 
#    exist. Exits with value 1 and error print statement if the file could not be created.
#    
#    Example:
#    
#       writer.sh /tmp/aesd/assignment1/sample.txt ios
#    
#    Creates file:
#    
#       /tmp/aesd/assignment1/sample.txt
#    
#           With content:
#    
#               ios
